# 📸 FTP + Wireshark Lab: Visual Walkthrough

This document showcases the key stages of the FTP and Wireshark lab in images. These visuals help demonstrate the risks of insecure communication and how packet sniffing can expose credentials.

## 🖥️ 1. FileZilla FTP Server Setup  
Installed and configured FileZilla FTP Server on the Windows 10 VM with users "Que" and "Nangamso".

## 🔥 2. Allowing FTP Traffic Through Windows Firewall  
Created a firewall rule to allow incoming FTP traffic on the Windows 10 VM so the Kali Linux box can communicate over the network.

## 🌐 3. Kali Linux Listening with Wireshark  
Launched Wireshark on Kali to capture traffic from the network, targeting FTP login attempts.

## ⚠️ 5. Captured FTP Credentials in Cleartext  
Wireshark successfully captured and displayed the FTP login credentials — showing how unencrypted protocols can leak sensitive information.
